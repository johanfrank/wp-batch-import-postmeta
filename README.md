WP Batch import postmeta
========================

Export and import your Wordpress posts of any type to a handy CSV file, with your own post meta fields definitions.

Just download and activate to use plugin.

Under `Tools` you'll find where to set up your batch exports (`Batch settings`).

Use `Batch export posts` to create a CSV file. Download, edit and then upload it using `Batch import posts`.

**Note:** Try this out locally before using it in a production environment. I take no responsibility for any bugs or possible problems related to this project.
